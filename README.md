# CloudTrax Technical Documentation

*This is preliminary documentation. It applies only to networks running under CloudTrax 4.*

This is technical documentation for CloudTrax-related services. These documents fall into two general areas:

### CloudTrax API ###
Full technical detail of a [RESTful API](./api) that provides low-level access to your CloudTrax network and data. You can configure and fully manage your network and nodes and can build a full replacement of the CloudTrax Dashboard if desired.

### Captive Portal ###

CloudTrax' [Captive Portal](./captive_portal) facilities allow you to host and access splash pages both internally within CloudTrax and externally using UAM. These pages can talk to a variety of authentication services, ranging from a built-in vouchering system, to RADIUS servers, to a backend Authentication Server of your own devising.
