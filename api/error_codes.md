# API Error codes

This table shows error codes and their associated descriptions. Strings enclosed by '$'  are replaced during error processing. Note that code "1009" is a special "non-error" error code that is used to indicate "success" when an API call returns a 200 Response without any accompanying JSON output of its own. "14001" is one other example of a "non-error" error.

(See [Errors](README.md#errors) for furtherdetails.)
