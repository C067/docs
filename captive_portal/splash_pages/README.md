# Splash Pages

The CloudTrax Dashboard provides two mechanisms for hosting and managing splash pages:

* **[Custom splash pages](./custom/)**, in which HTML is hosted on the Access Point.
* **[Remote splash pages](./external)**, in which pages are generated and hosted on an external server you configure, using the UAM protocol.

Both allow you to use CloudTrax' full range of authentication options.
