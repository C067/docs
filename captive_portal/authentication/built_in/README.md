# Voucher-based authentication

CloudTrax supports a built-in authentication system using vouchers. General information on the vouchering system can be found in the help document, [Using Vouchers in CloudTrax](https://help.cloudtrax.com/hc/en-us/articles/202521890-Using-Vouchers-in-CloudTrax) (*currently applicable to CloudTrax CT3 only*). 

If your users are going to be logging in from a CloudTrax-hosted "custom" splash page, you'll need to make sure that splash page contains a voucher-compatible login form. Refer to [Custom Splash Pages](../../splash_pages/custom) for details.
