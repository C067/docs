# Authentication Services

This section describes facilities for authenticating users and devices connecting to a CloudTrax Access Point. These range from the built-in internal CloudTrax service that authenticates users based on [vouchers](./built_in), to third-party services such as [RADIUS servers](./radius), to a backend authentication server of your own devising ([HTTP Authentication](./http)).
